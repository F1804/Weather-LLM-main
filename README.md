# Weather-LLM-main

React + Vite
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

@vitejs/plugin-react uses Babel for Fast Refresh
@vitejs/plugin-react-swc uses SWC for Fast Refresh


Steps to Run
node mqtt_weather_receiver.js

npm run dev

docker-compose build

docker-compose up
